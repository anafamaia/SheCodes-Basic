      <h3>1. Because you'll save a life.</h3> 
      Each year, it's estimated that more than
      one million adoptable dogs are euthanized in the United States,
      simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people
      consider adoption when looking for a pet. 
      <h3>2. Because you'll get a great animal.</h3>
      Animal shelters and rescue groups are brimming with happy, healthy
      pets just waiting for someone to take them home. Most shelter pets wound
      up there because of a human problem like a move or a divorce, not because
      the animals did anything wrong. Many are already house-trained and used to
      living with families.
    <h3>3.Because you'll change a homeless animal's whole world.</h3>
    And get a new best friend out of the deal.
